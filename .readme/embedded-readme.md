# Recent JetBrains Projects for Alfred

An Alfred workflow for opening your JetBrains IDEs projects

## Getting started

### ⚠️ Assign a keyword for every IDE you use ⚠️

By default, all IDEs are disabled. Assigning keywords activates specific IDEs.

Keyword settings are persisted across workflow upgrades.

## How to Use

**_For more information, check detailed [README](https://github.com/artemy/alfred-jetbrains-projects/blob/master/README.md)_**

Open Alfred and type the keyword for your IDE. The workflow will display a list of recent
projects (sorted by time last opened descending).

You can further filter a project list by typing additional characters. Fuzzy first-letter search is supported (i.e.,
typing `map` will find `my-awesome-project`).
